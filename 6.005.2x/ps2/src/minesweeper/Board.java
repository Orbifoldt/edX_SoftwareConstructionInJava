    // Abstraction function
    //      A board in a game of minesweeper is a rectangle (whose dimensions are specified by width and height)
    //      which consists out of a number of squares. Each square has it's own state (untouched, dug or flagged),
    //      and does or does not conatain a bomb. The averaged number of bombs can be governed by CHANCE_BOMBS.
    //      (See also the Square class for more about a square in a game of minesweeper)
    //      The coordinates of each square inside the rectangle are given by its indices inside this.squares.
    //
    // Rep invariant
    //      - number of players is always greater or equal to zero
    //      - the width and height are greater than zero
    //      - number of columns == width
    //      - number of elements of each column == height
    //      - the square at index (y,x) inside this.squares (i.e. squares.get(y).get(x)) has coordinate (x,y)
    //      - if a square is dug it cannot contain a bomb (this does not hold for the Square class itself however)
    //
    // Safety from rep exposure
    //      - Most of the fields are private and immutable and can only changed by using a setter method
    //      - The field squares is not immutable, but it is final, private and is never returned by any method.
    //        Only in the constructor are elements added to this field. By checking the rep invariant at appropriate
    //        times we make sure that it does not change in our methods. The elements of the elements of this field
    //        can be changed by using their setters, but this is in accordance to how the game works
    //
    // Thread safety
    //      - Monitor pattern: All access to the fields happens inside the methods of Board and all these
    //        methods are guarded by this Boards lock. This is sufficient since all fields are private.
    //      - The field squares is a synchronized list of synchronized lists, so all get and add methods
    //        on this field are atomic. The Square elements are thread-safe, so any number of mutations of
    //        such an element cannot happen concurrently, i.e. they are serialized. This combined with the
    //        fact that the mutation methods of this field are synchronized implies the thread safety of
    //        the field squares.
